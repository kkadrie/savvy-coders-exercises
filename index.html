  <h1>Welcome to my homepage - Karim Kadrie</h1>

  <p>My name is Karim Kadrie and started to learn how to code in January 2017.  To me, it like learning a new language.  I studied French for nine years throughout high school and college.  However, I became fluent in the language once I was immersed in the culture over a summer.  All that to say is just dive into coding to start learning and you will become a coder in no time! </p>
